# 10XGenomicsDataAnalysis
Course materials for Day 3 10X Genomics data analysis (Seurat) of the Single-Cell RNAseq Training Course 2021.

## Session Overview
In this session we will cover:
1. The theory behind ‘downstream’ single-cell analysis with a focus on 10X Genomics data
2. How to analyse a single-cell dataset using the Seurat Package
3. Address some of the assumptions/difficulties you may run into when analysing single-cell data
